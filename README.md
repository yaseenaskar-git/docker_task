# Assignment #4: Application Containerization

This is a simple Node.js web application designed for learning Docker containerization concepts.

## Application Overview

This application is a basic Express.js web server that:
- Serves a static HTML page at the root (`/`)
- Provides an API status endpoint at `/api/status`
- Includes a health check endpoint at `/health`
- Runs on port 3000 by default (configurable via PORT environment variable)

## What's Included

- **app.js**: Main application server file
- **package.json**: Node.js dependencies and project configuration
- **public/index.html**: Static HTML page that confirms successful containerization
- **public/style.css**: Styling for the web page

## Running Without Docker (for reference only)

If you wanted to run this application directly (not required for assignment):
```bash
npm install
npm start
```

## Your Docker Assignment

**DO NOT MODIFY THE APPLICATION CODE**

Your task is to containerize this existing application using Docker. You need to:

1. Create a `Dockerfile` that properly containerizes this Node.js application
2. Build a Docker image from your Dockerfile
3. Run a container from your image
4. Verify the application works by accessing it in your browser

## Starting the Application

- To build the docker image run the command:

```bash

```

- To run your docker container in port 3000 run the command:

```bash

```

## Reflection Question
**Answer the following question in the space below**: How does containerization with Docker differ from using virtual machines, and why might a development team choose Docker containers over VMs for deploying applications like the one you just containerized?



## Application Requirements for Docker

Your Dockerfile should ensure:
- The application has Node.js runtime available
- All application files are copied into the container
- Dependencies are installed (`npm install`)
- Port 3000 is exposed
- The application starts with `npm start`
- The container can be accessed from your host machine

## Verification

When your Docker container is running correctly:
- Navigate to `http://localhost:3000` (or whatever port you mapped)
- You should see a success page confirming containerization worked
- The `/api/status` endpoint should return JSON status information

## Troubleshooting Tips

- Make sure your port mapping is correct in the `docker run` command
- Check that all files are copied into the container
- Verify Node.js dependencies are installed in the container
- Use `docker logs <container-name>` to see application output

## File Structure Expected
